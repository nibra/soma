# What is SOMA? – A Non-Technical Introduction

## SOMA: A Digital Nervous System for Organizations

### What is SOMA?

SOMA stands for **Stream-Oriented Message-Driven Agent Architecture**. It is a digital system that automatically processes and responds to messages from emails, social networks, and other sources—like a team of virtual colleagues that constantly reads, understands, and supports workflows.

### What can SOMA do?

SOMA can:

- Detect and process feedback from social media
- Automatically generate article drafts or internal to-dos
- Support developer teams by triaging issues and reviewing content
- Analyze message streams (emails, posts, etc.) and convert them into structured tasks

### How does the system work?

SOMA is made up of digital “agents”—small specialized programs that take on specific roles. These agents:

1. **Read messages** from email, forums, or social platforms  
2. **Process the content** using AI or rule-based logic  
3. **Communicate internally** to coordinate tasks  
4. **Trigger actions** like writing an article, submitting a review, or generating a report

Everything runs **fully automated in the background**, like a digital nervous system.

### Where can SOMA be applied?

| Use Case | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| 🏛 **Municipal Administration** | Auto-generates website content based on social media and citizen feedback |
| 🛠 **Software Development** | Virtual team members help review, plan, and respond to tasks |
| 📢 **Public Communication** | Early detection and reaction to trending topics |
| 🧾 **Monitoring & Documentation** | Transparent logging of decisions and actions |

### What SOMA is not

- Not a chatbot  
- Not a replacement for human judgment  
- Not a data collector without oversight  
→ All sources, agents, and responses are individually configurable and fully traceable.

### Why it matters

SOMA creates a digital infrastructure to handle communication, information, and response efficiently and transparently—whether in government or software teams.
